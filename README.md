# ETH-AVAX-Module-3
## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a token smart contract in Solidity. The `Function` contract allows for minting tokens, burning tokens, and transferring tokens between addresses.

## Features

- **Minting Tokens**: The contract owner can mint new tokens to any specified address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Users can burn (destroy) their own tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Tokens can be transferred between addresses.

## Deployment

To deploy the contract, you can use Remix or any other Solidity development environment. Make sure to specify the `name` and `symbol` parameters during deployment.


### Steps

1. **Compile**: Compile the `module3.sol` file using your preferred Solidity compiler.
   
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum blockchain. Specify the `name` and `symbol` parameters during deployment.

3. **Interact**: After deployment, interact with the contract to mint tokens, burn tokens, and transfer tokens between addresses.
